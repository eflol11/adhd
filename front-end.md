# Front-End Distinctive Design Skill

Create real, working frontend code with a clear aesthetic point of view.
Avoid generic, repetitive AI aesthetics.

## Core Mission

Build production-grade interfaces that are:
- Functional and shippable
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive in tone and art direction
- Refined in spacing, typography, motion, and detail

## Workflow

### 1) Define the Design Intent Before Coding

- Clarify purpose: identify what the interface solves and who uses it.
- Choose tone: commit to one strong direction (e.g., editorial, brutalist, luxury, playful, industrial, retro-futuristic, soft organic).
- Capture constraints: include framework, accessibility targets, performance budget, and device priorities.
- Define differentiation: identify one unforgettable signature element.

**Rule:** Commit to one conceptual direction and execute it with precision.

### 2) Implement Production-Grade Code

- Produce working HTML/CSS/JS (or React/Vue as requested).
- Use semantic structure and accessible patterns by default.
- Keep code maintainable with clear naming and reusable patterns.
- Match implementation complexity to the chosen style.

## Aesthetic Execution Guidelines

### Typography

- Use characterful, high-quality font pairings.
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- Avoid default/generic font stacks unless explicitly required.

### Color and Theme

- Use CSS variables/tokens for palette consistency.
- Prefer clear color hierarchy: dominant base + intentional accents.
- Maintain sufficient contrast and visual rhythm.

### Motion and Interaction

- Use motion with intent, not noise.
- Prefer CSS-first animation for HTML/CSS projects.
- Prioritize high-impact moments: entry sequence, staggered reveal, meaningful hover/focus states.
- Keep reduced-motion support for accessibility.

### Layout and Composition

- Break predictable patterns when appropriate: asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, controlled density, or generous negative space.
- Use deliberate hierarchy and scanning paths.
- Ensure layout remains readable and usable on small screens.

### Atmosphere and Detail

- Add contextual depth: textures, layered gradients, mesh backdrops, borders, shadow systems, and subtle overlays.
- Keep details coherent with the aesthetic direction.
- Avoid decorative effects that reduce clarity.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Do not produce cookie-cutter output.
Specifically avoid:
- Generic font defaults and overused combinations
- Trend clichés applied without context
- Formulaic component composition
- “One-style-fits-all” output reused across projects

## Quality Bar

Before finalizing, verify:
- Distinct visual identity is obvious in under 3 seconds.
- Design decisions feel intentional and coherent.
- Interaction states (hover/focus/active/loading) are polished.
- Mobile/tablet/desktop behavior is responsive and robust.
- Accessibility and readability are preserved.

## Deliverable Expectations

Provide:
- Working code ready to run
- Brief rationale of the chosen aesthetic direction
- Notes on responsiveness and accessibility decisions
- Any setup instructions required to preview locally
